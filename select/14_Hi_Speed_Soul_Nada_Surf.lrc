[00:27.63] Do you ever feel like you just landed on this earth?
[00:34.62] You see the creatures all do their dances back and forth
[00:41.57] You get restless and then you join them on the floor
[00:48.79] Suddenly it's tomorrow
[00:59.79] 
[00:52.40] It's not today anymore (X2)
[01:05.90] 
[01:03.51] Chorus:
[01:07.01] 
[01:04.12] You talk to the ceiling every day
[01:09.92] The speakers are shaking
[01:11.90] Why do i hear you okay?
[01:18.19] They're playing soul at the wrong speed
[01:24.26] It sounds right now
[01:26.36] What are you doing to me?
[01:38.86] 
[01:52.14] D'you ever feel like what we call real life is not so real?
[01:58.61] Tripping up on the same old problems you had last year
[02:05.67] We'll pretend it's another planet not so uptight
[02:12.91] The stars are shining above the city every night
[02:21.62] They come every night
[02:32.12] 
[02:27.45] Chorus (x1)
[02:32.95] 
[02:59.14] Where are we going?
[02:59.71] I don't care
[03:03.05] Our friends all left
[03:05.08] Let's go anywhere
[03:10.83] It's getting late
[03:12.86] I don't care
[03:17.25] It's just you and me
[03:19.39] Let's go anywhere
