(Watch it)
Relax, pump the brakes
You're speeding, money
(Watch it)
You'll smash your whole shit up
Man, chill (slow down)
Lights be changing fast on these streets, money, slow down
(Watch it)
(Slow down)
Sleeping on the wrong cats (slow down)
Clear like a megaphone
Pretty nigga heart skipped the metronome
Rocked the Trump Tower to the terrordome
Poor house to pleasure domes
Soprano, alto, tenor to baritone
Mos Def one of the illest that you ever known
Rock steady, baby, you a stepping stone
Smash your foundation into pebbles
My words leave your nerves unsettled
You take it to the next level down
Looking like a circus clown
Cats like you can't even get a pound
Worldwide from the river to lakeside
My stage show stay live, make the sound man stage dive
I cut fat cats to eight lives with my eight ball lines
I'm home 'fore I'm done with all nine
Got you shook like a fault line
Come all shine and get tarnished
Brooklyn got your pay roll garnished
They form a huddle
Whisper like they want trouble
I melt the ice grills into rainwater puddles
Make the proud-hearted leave on the humble
Black steel in the hour
Assemble my skill form my power
My poems crush bones into powder
You mumble like a coward
I'm Mos Def, you need to speak louder
Super heroes
Get your power, your masks and capes snatched
Brooklyn take what you can't take back
I know a lot of cats hate that
All I can say black
There's a city full of walls you can post complaints at
All the doubters and believers adjust your receivers
Feel it, you can taste it through the speakers
The three six original sketch lyrics so visual
They rent my rhyme books at your nearest home video
Tell them cats they need to sit back (slow down)
And observe where they at (slow down)
Brook-nahm Vietnam (slow down)
The heat is on
Put your joint on cruise (slow down)
Try to rush you scuff your brake shoes
Just cool and relax (slow down)
Take a breath, take ten paces back (slow down)
Stay on time like Omegas (slow down)
Brooklyn patrol like interstaters (just slow)
Take their license and their registration papers (just slow down)
My joint's so passionate
Make you peel out and mash your shit
Get wild cold crash your whip
Front chassis wrecked, but akh' you can't be too upset
Tow truck got my tape in the deck
I'm permanent like tattoos and birth marks
Third degree burn marks
Driving on tracks like Dale Earnhardt
Stay on the low like the herb spot
Put a big loss on your earn chart
Nice since the nurse signed my birth chart
Seldom seen but often heard, while your jams is barely heard
Just my name is a daily word
From avenues to streets, terraces and park places
Stair wells, jail cells, penthouse to basements
Arrangement basic, but still fans chase it
Y2k can't delete the true ancient
Apache war drum on the ranges
Skill level dangerous
Arrow head that killed all the cavemen
They cry John-Blazing, but step on the pavement
And get violated like a plaintiff
I ain't shit to play with
I give a Goddamn what your name is
Delete it and make it so it never get repeated
Believe it
Tell the feds, tell your girl, tell your mother
Conference call you wack crew and tell each other
That they just ain't holding me
I'm Mos Def, your hopefully
Mush off or you get bust off like a ovary
Tell them cats they need to ease back (slow down)
And observe where they at (slow down)
Brook-nahm Vietnam (slow down)
The heat is on
Put your joint on cruise (slow down)
In a rush and scuff your brake shoes
Just cool and relax (slow down)
Take a breath, take ten paces back (slow down)
Brook-nahm Vietnam
The heat is on, no off-ramp or detour
Make these gassed up jokers observe the speed law
Make these gassed up clowns observe the speed law
Make these gassed up clowns observe the speed law
'Cause they speeding, speeding, speeding, speeding, speeding
Speeding, speeding, speeding, speeding, speeding
Speeding, speeding, speeding, speeding, speeding
Relax (woo)
Slow down, you better chill, money (slow down)
Lights be changing fast on these streets, dude (slow down)
It'll smash your whole shit up (slow down)
Better cool out, money (slow down)
It ain't like that out here (slow down)
(Slow down)
Look at these cats, man (slow down), it's funny, man (slow down)
Probably just got that car (slow down)
About to fuck your whole shit up (slow down)
Speed laws out here, money (slow down)
(Slow down, slow down)
Knight riding cats (slow down)
In control like interstaters, stay the, stay the
Staters, stay the, stay the, stay the, stay the
Staters, stay the, stay the, stay the, stay the
Stay the fuck off the road, money
