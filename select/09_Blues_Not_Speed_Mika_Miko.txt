So messed up because of you
My heart's gone ill
There's nothing I can do
Play in hay, dig in rough
All you do is just to get a cup

Walk in the sand
You can hold my hand
Hey, hey
Sleep today
Or you'll look insane
It ain't easy
Oh it's so hard
A doubtful mind won't get you far

I don't know you will end up
Where you end up
Trying to get enough to fill your's up
It's free, it's free
I never heard of a place like that
Because I've seen enough
And I ain't that tough
But I'll leave it clean

Oh oh ooh ooh
Leave it
Oh oh ooh ooh
Leave it
Oh oh ooh ooh
Leave it clean

I got blues not speed in my cup
My foolish heart ain't rough
