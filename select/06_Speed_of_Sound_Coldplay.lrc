[00:18.50] How long before I get in?
[00:22.08] Before it starts, before I begin
[00:26.37] How long before you decide?
[00:30.02] Before I know what it feels like
[00:34.13] Where to, where do I go?
[00:37.32] If you've never tried then you'll never know
[00:42.11] How long do I have to climb
[00:45.39] Up on the side of this mountain of mine?
[01:05.39] 
[01:05.31] Look up, I look up at night
[01:08.83] Planets are moving at the speed of light
[01:13.17] Climb up, up in the trees
[01:16.85] Every chance that you get
[01:18.42] Is a chance you seize
[01:21.12] How long am I gonna stand
[01:24.68] With my head stuck under the sand?
[01:28.89] I'll start before I can stop
[01:32.30] Or before I see things the right way up
[01:51.80] 
[01:37.43] All that noise, and all that sound
[01:54.43] 
[01:44.46] All those places I got found
[01:51.96] And birds go flying at the speed of sound
[01:56.19] To show you how it all began
[02:00.42] Birds came flying from the underground
[02:03.98] If you could see it then you'd understand
[02:24.48] 
[02:25.58] Ideas that you'll never find
[02:28.76] All the inventors could never design
[02:33.33] The buildings that you put up
[02:36.73] Japan and China, all lit up
[02:40.74] The sign that I couldn't read
[02:44.77] Or a light that I couldn't see
[02:49.35] Some things you have to believe
[02:52.39] But others are puzzles, puzzling me
[03:09.89] 
[02:57.48] All that noise, and all that sound
[03:05.23] All those places I got found
[03:19.23] 
[03:12.46] And birds go flying at the speed of sound
[03:16.40] To show you how it all began
[03:20.47] Birds came flying from the underground
[03:23.68] If you could see it then you'd understand
[03:27.91] Ah, when you see it then you'll understand
[03:48.91] 
[03:50.17] All those signs, I knew what they meant
[03:54.30] Some things you can't invent
[03:58.35] Some get made, and some get sent
[04:14.35] 
[04:05.34] Birds go flying at the speed of sound
[04:12.85] To show you how it all began
[04:16.28] Birds came flying from the underground
[04:20.37] If you could see it then you'd understand
[04:44.84] Ah, when you see it then you'll understand
